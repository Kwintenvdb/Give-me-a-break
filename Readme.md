# Give me a break

Office simulation

* 2 Dimensions -> Stress and Income
* Send employees on breaks
  * slack off
  * toilet break
  * coffee break
  * lunch break
  * vacation (+ stress to others because work still has to be done)
* assign employees to teams that have different stress/reward level
* see only a part of the world at the same time -> camera has to move around
* stress influences in a radius around
* breaks take time to get there as well
* cat cats / emotes for employees
* micromanagement/stress game, humor
